usage:
./as3 INPUT-FILE (bez extension or obj extension) [step size/error bound (*)] [-a] [-o FILENAME]

* The step size parameter should be omitted for OBJ files as it is not needed.

-this will render the bez file using uniform tessellation.
flags:
-a : this will turn on the adaptive tessellation and the step size becomes the error bound.
-o : calling this flag will output a .obj version of the .bez file you enter.

commands:
'w' : toggle between wireframe of the rendered object and the shaded object.
's' : toggle smooth shading and flat shading.
'h' : toggle hidden line mode
'n' : toggle into display normal mode, where you could see the normal of surface.
'b' : toggle into solid color mode, where you could see the distinct shapes.
'left', 'right' : arrow key will rotate the object about the x-axis
'up', 'down' : arrow key will rotate the object about the y-axis.
'z', 'x' : will rotate the object by the z-axis. (z is negative, x is positive)
'shift' + 'up', 'down', 'right', 'left' : will translate the object towards the pressed direction.
'j', 'k': toggle between next and previous files when a .scene is loaded

COMPILE:
This compiles on OS X 10.8+, including the lab machines.
(specific machine tested was Viking.cs)

Extra Credit:
These features are specifically mentioned as extra credit:
* implementation of 'h' key
* reading of OBJ files
* output / conversion of OBJ files
The following were implemented for fun:
* 'b' key for random coloring
* 'n' key for displaying normals
* 'x' 'z' for z-axis rotation
* display of multiple objects via a .scene file

NOTES:
* teapot.obj and teapotAdaptive.obj were rendered by our program
* The android was found online
* To compile glm should be placed in lib/glm (this is NOT included in the submission)
* objects in a .scene must be relative to the path of the program, not the scene file
* adaptive shading, and error or subdivision parameter are global for all objects, except from .obj files
* the scene file handles OBJ files too.
* only 1 object is displayed at a time.
