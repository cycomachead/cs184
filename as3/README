usage:
./as3 INPUT-FILE (bez extension or obj extension) [step size/error bound (*)] [-a] [-o FILENAME]

* The step size parameter should be omitted for OBJ files as it is not needed.

-this will render the bez file using uniform tessellation.
flags:
-a : this will turn on the adaptive tessellation and the step size becomes the error bound.
-o : calling this flag will output a .obj version of the .bez file you enter.

commands:
'w' : toggle between wireframe of the rendered object and the shaded object.
's' : toggle smooth shading and flat shading.
'h' : toggle hidden line mode
'n' : toggle into display normal mode, where you could see the normal of surface.
'b' : toggle into solid color mode, where you could see the distinct shapes.
'left', 'right' : arrow key will rotate the object about the x-axis
'up', 'down' : arrow key will rotate the object about the y-axis.
'z', 'x' : will rotate the object by the z-axis. (z is negative, x is positive)
'shift' + 'up', 'down', 'right', 'left' : will translate the object towards the pressed direction.

COMPILE:
This compiles on OS X 10.8+, including the lab machines.

Extra Credit:
These features are specifically mentioned as extra credit:
* implementation of 'h' key
* reading of OBJ files
* output / conversion of OBJ files
The following were implemented for fun:
* 'b' key for random coloring
* 'n' key for displaying normals
* 'x' 'z' for z-axis rotation
