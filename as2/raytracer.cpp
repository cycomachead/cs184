Shape
            Methods:
                        // Test if ray intersects with the shape or not (in object space), if so,
// return intersection point and normal

            Notes:

AggregatePrimitive
            Methods:

            Notes:
                        Constructor store the STL vector of pointers to primitives.
                        Intersect just loops through all the primitives in the list and
call the intersect routine. Compare thit and return that of the nearest one (because we want the first hit).
 Also, the in->primitive should be set to the pointer to that primitive.
                        When you implement acceleration structure, it will replace this class.
 
Material
            Members:
                        BRDF constantBRDF;
            Methods:
void getBRDF(LocalGeo& local, BRDF* brdf) {
            return constantBRDF;
}
            Notes:
                        Class for storing material. For this example, it just returns a constant
                        material regardless of what local is. Later on, when we want to support
                        texture mapping, this need to be modified.
 
Camera
            Methods:
                        void generateRay(Sample& sample, Ray* ray);
            Notes:
                        Create a ray starting from the camera that passes through the
                        corresponding pixel (sample.x, sample.y) on the image plane.
                        (from last week discussion, and also section 10.1 in Shirleyâ€™s book)
 
RayTracer
            Methods:
                        void trace(Ray& ray, int depth, Color* color) {
                                    if (depth exceed some threshold) {
                                                Make the color black and return
                                    }
                                    if (!primitive.intersect(ray, &thit, &in) {
                                                // No intersection
                                                Make the color black and return
                                    }
                                    // Obtain the brdf at intersection point
                                    in.primitive->getBRDF(in.local, &brdf);
 
                                    // There is an intersection, loop through all light source
                                    for (i = 0; i < #lights; i++) {
                                                lights[i].generateLightRay(in.local, &lray, &lcolor);
                                               
                                                // Check if the light is blocked or not
                                                if (!primitive->intersectP(lray))
// If not, do shading calculation for this
// light source
                                                            *color += shading(in.local, brdf, lray, lcolor);
}
 
// Handle mirror reflection
if (brdf.kr > 0) {
            reflectRay = createReflectRay(in.local, ray);
 
            // Make a recursive call to trace the reflected ray
            trace(reflectRay, depth+1, &tempColor);
            *color += brdf.kr * tempColor;
}
                                   
                        }
 
            Notes:
                        Shading is similar to hw2
                        Beware when you generate reflection ray, make sure the ray donâ€™t start
exactly on the surface, or the intersection routine may return
intersection point at the starting point of the ray. (This apply to light
ray generation as well)
 
Light
            Methods:
                        void generateLightRay(LocalGeo& local, Ray* lray, Color* lcolor);
            Notes:
                        This is an abstract class that will generate a ray starting from
                        the position stored in local to the position of the light source.
                        You might want to consider creating 2 derived classes for
                        point light source and directional light source.
For directional light, the origin of the ray is the same, and the ray points to the light direction, however, t_max is infinity.
  

Scene
            Methods:
                        // This is the main rendering loop
                        void render() {
                                    while (!sampler.generateSample(&sample) {
                                                camera.generateRay(sample, &ray);
                                                raytracer.trace(ray, &color);
                                                film.commit(sample, color);
                                    }
                                    film.writeImage();
                        }
